# QuranicVerificationUsingANN
 This GitHub repository contains code for a project aimed at verifying Quranic verses using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) techniques. The goal of this project is to develop a model that can validate verses and surahs in the Quran based on voice inputs, which are transformed into indexes of surah and verse locations in the Quran. The repository includes the implementation of pre-processing techniques, MFCC for feature extraction, and different ANN architectures for the classification task. The results and analysis of the experimentation are also included in this repository.
